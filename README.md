## Covid Patients' Phylogenetic Tree
Visualizing and constructing the phylogenetic tree of the spike protein gene using SARS-CoV-2 sequence data taken from 100 patients on 6 different days. Further explanation and steps are in the file `Covid_Phylogenetic_Tree.ipynb` with the relevant code. 

The data of the SARS-CoV-2 virus used for this project is curated by [Kunal Joshi & Phillip Compeau](https://compeau.cbd.cmu.edu/online-education/sars-cov-2-software-assignments/sars-cov-2-evolutionary-tree-multiple-alignment-challenge/). The data set includes the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 taken from 100 randomly selected individuals at six different time points between 2020-11-03 and 2021-12-08 (the data for 2020-11-17 are corrupted). Only the gene that encodes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus was used by extracting the nucleotite sequence between positions 21563 and 25384.

The data can be downloaded from [this](http://compeau.cbd.cmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UK-Coronavirus-Data.zip) link and is included in this repository.
